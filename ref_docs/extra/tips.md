# Tips

## Summary

Development tips and best practices for ComfyUI custom node development.

## Recommended Development Lifecycle

### Initial Setup

1. **Start with a clear concept**: Define what your custom node will do and what inputs/outputs it needs
2. **Study existing nodes**: Look at similar nodes in the ComfyUI codebase for inspiration and patterns
3. **Set up your development environment**: Ensure you have proper Python setup and ComfyUI installed

### Development Process

1. **Create a minimal working node**: Start with the simplest possible implementation
2. **Test early and often**: Verify your node works with basic inputs before adding complexity
3. **Follow naming conventions**: Use clear, descriptive names for your nodes and parameters
4. **Handle errors gracefully**: Implement proper error handling and user feedback

### Code Quality

1. **Use type hints**: Specify input and output types clearly
2. **Add documentation**: Include docstrings and comments explaining your node's purpose
3. **Keep it simple**: Avoid unnecessary complexity in your implementations
4. **Follow Python conventions**: Use PEP 8 style guidelines

### Testing and Validation

1. **Test with various inputs**: Try different input types and edge cases
2. **Verify output types**: Ensure your node produces the expected output format
3. **Test integration**: Check that your node works well with other ComfyUI nodes
4. **Performance testing**: Monitor memory usage and execution time

### Distribution and Maintenance

1. **Create example workflows**: Provide clear examples of how to use your nodes
2. **Write good documentation**: Include installation instructions and usage examples
3. **Version your releases**: Use semantic versioning for your custom node packages
4. **Respond to issues**: Be responsive to user feedback and bug reports

## Best Practices

### Node Design

- **Single responsibility**: Each node should have one clear purpose
- **Consistent interfaces**: Use similar patterns for similar types of operations
- **Intuitive parameters**: Make parameter names and types obvious to users
- **Reasonable defaults**: Provide sensible default values for optional parameters

### Error Handling

- **Validate inputs**: Check input types and ranges before processing
- **Provide clear error messages**: Help users understand what went wrong
- **Fail gracefully**: Don't crash the entire workflow if possible
- **Log important events**: Use logging for debugging and monitoring

### Performance

- **Optimize critical paths**: Profile your code and optimize bottlenecks
- **Memory management**: Be conscious of memory usage, especially with large tensors
- **Lazy evaluation**: Only compute what's needed when it's needed
- **Cache when appropriate**: Store expensive computations if they might be reused

### User Experience

- **Clear naming**: Use descriptive names for nodes and parameters
- **Helpful tooltips**: Provide context for complex parameters
- **Logical grouping**: Group related parameters together
- **Visual feedback**: Provide progress indicators for long-running operations

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Assuming input types**: Always validate and convert inputs as needed
2. **Memory leaks**: Properly manage tensor lifetimes and GPU memory
3. **Blocking operations**: Use async operations for long-running tasks
4. **Hardcoded paths**: Make file paths configurable and cross-platform
5. **Ignoring edge cases**: Test with empty inputs, extreme values, etc.

## Development Tools and Resources

### Debugging

- Use Python's built-in debugger (`pdb`) for stepping through code
- Add logging statements to track execution flow
- Use ComfyUI's developer tools for inspecting node execution

### Testing

- Create unit tests for your node logic
- Test with different input combinations
- Verify output formats and types

### Documentation

- Include docstrings in your Python code
- Create README files with installation and usage instructions
- Provide example workflows to demonstrate functionality

## Community Guidelines

- **Be helpful**: Respond to user questions and issues
- **Share knowledge**: Contribute to the community with tips and examples
- **Follow conventions**: Use established patterns and naming conventions
- **Credit sources**: Acknowledge any code or ideas you've borrowed

## Continuous Improvement

- **Gather feedback**: Listen to user suggestions and complaints
- **Monitor performance**: Track how your nodes perform in real workflows
- **Stay updated**: Keep up with ComfyUI updates and new features
- **Iterate**: Continuously improve your nodes based on usage patterns
