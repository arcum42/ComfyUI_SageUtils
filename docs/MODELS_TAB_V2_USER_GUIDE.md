## Common Questions

### Why are some models showing twice?

They shouldn't! V2 automatically deduplicates symbolic links. If you see duplicates, they're actually different files with different hashes.

### How do I refresh the model list?

Click the **Refresh** button in "Collection Actions" at the top.

### Can I select multiple models?

Not yet! Multi-select is planned for a future update. For now, use the Scan or Report actions to work with multiple models.

### Why isn't keyboard navigation working?

You need to **focus the model browser first:**
- Click anywhere in the model list
- Or press Tab until it's focused
- You'll see a focus outline when it's active

### How do I go back to the old Models tab?

Open browser console (F12) and run:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('sage_use_models_v2', 'false');
location.reload();
```

But why would you want to? üòä

## Troubleshooting

### Models Not Showing

**Try:**
1. Click "Refresh" button
2. Check your filters (set all to "All")
3. Clear search box (press Escape)
4. Reload ComfyUI page

### Slow Performance

**Try:**
1. Use filters to show fewer models
2. Use hierarchical view
3. Collapse all folders
4. Use search instead of scrolling

### Can't See Model Details

**Make sure:**
1. Model is actually selected (green background)
2. Scroll down to see info panel
3. If no info shows, model may not have metadata
